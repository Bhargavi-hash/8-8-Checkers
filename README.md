# 8-8-Checkers

Checkers (also known as Draughts) is a popular group
of board games. The most commonly played one is an
8x8 version of American Checkers (also known as En-
glish Draughts). Here, you will be developing a terminal
version of this game.

# Features

1) A feature to UNDO as many moves as asked by the
   players (provided both players agree).
2) A feature to REVIEW the game from the start, so
   the players can see what led to the current game
   state if they wish to.
3) A feature to SHOW ALL POSSIBLE MOVES for
   the next k turns (if both players make a move each,
   that is counted as two turns), where k is a number
   that the player gives.
